Extends your online saved jpeg (for example from canvas) with EXIF data. 
Or just view what data are present in the exif section.

The project consists of a simple and easy-to-read library that allow you to read the jpeg sections and debug it on the browser.

You can use it to add some exif information (like copyright, date, etc.) to simple jpeg, for example the one generated over a canvas.
